## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### API Key Configuration
Create a file named `api_key.py` in the root directory of the Timmy project. Place your API key inside the file in the following format:

```python
# api_key.py
apiKey = "<PLACE YOUR KEY HERE>"
```

Replace `<PLACE YOUR KEY HERE>` with your actual API key.

## Running the Application

Once you have installed the required libraries and configured the API key, you can run the Timmy application for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Use the following command:

streamlit run app_EDA.py
```

This will start the Timmy application, and you can access it through your web browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
